Please note that restrictions imposed by this patent (and possibly others) exist independently of and may be in conflict with the freedoms granted in this license, which refers to copyrights in the program, not patents or any methods it implements. Both copyright and patent law must be obeyed to legally and redistribute this program and it is not the purpose of this license to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims.  If you redistribute or use the program, then this license merely protects you from committing copyright infringement.  It does not protect you from committing patent infringement.  So, before you do anything with this program, make sure that you have permission to do so not merely in terms of copyright, but also in terms of patent law. 
Please note that this license is not to be understood as a guarantee either.  If you use the program according to this license, but in conflict with patent law, it does not mean that the licensor will refund you for any losses that you incur if you are sued for your patent infringement.
